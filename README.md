## 📋 About

[Winds Howling](https://windshowling.netlify.app/) is a YouTube UI-inspired frontend built with a strong focus on **responsiveness** and **accessibility**, developed using **vanilla JavaScript** and a clean **modular architecture**. It thoughtfully combines procedural and functional programming techniques to keep the codebase simple, modular, and maintainable. Featuring videos containing information about Studio Ghibli movies.

It replicates the core UI and UX components of YouTube’s homepage, including:

- 📹 Video cards  
- 📂 Interactive side and top menus  
- 💬 Accessible modals  
- 🎙️ Voice search interaction  

This project shows practical coding skills without using heavy frameworks. It highlights a strong understanding of core JavaScript and good web development practices.

### 🌟 Acknowledgements

This project draws inspiration from several sources that helped shape its development:

- The design was inspired by [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) homepage, and video information was sourced from [Studio Ghibli](https://www.netflix.com/es-en/browse/genre/81227213) movies.
- Several **YouTube tutorials**, **forums**, and online documentation, such as **W3Schools** and **MDN** helped shape the development process.

## 🌱 Winds Howling: Evolution, Features and Limitations

### Development Approach

- **Goal:** A simple and accessible Winds Howling, responsive across all screen sizes, and easy to interact with.
- **Crafted with care:** Every aspect of the project, from the frontend to interactive features, was thoughtfully developed following best practices, with a strong focus on accessibility, performance, and user-centered design.
- **Accessible Event Handling:** The toggle modal events function was implemented to add the necessary accessible event listeners. This function is a streamlined version of the event handler used in [taskflow](https://github.com/angelvalentino/TaskFlow), providing adequate functionality for a project of this scope.

### Current Limitations

Although the project uses a mix of programming patterns and best practices, they were kept as simple as possible, without relying on an MVC architecture or similar. This makes the codebase simpler, but it also limits scalability. Moreover, there is no routing or backend, as it's a static front-end demo. Rather than supporting video playback, the project simulates the UI and is designed for demonstration and educational purposes, not for production use.

📌 Notwithstanding, there are no current plans to update this project, as it's considered to already fulfill its purpose in a clear, accessible, and responsive way.

### Accessibility (a11y) Overview

- **Inclusive Design:** The clone was built with inclusivity in mind, ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard support allows users to navigate and interact with all features without relying on a mouse or touch input.
- **ARIA Support:** ARIA attributes are applied judiciously to enhance accessibility without overcomplicating the markup, ensuring smooth interaction with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Semantic HTML:** Semantic HTML elements are used throughout to improve both accessibility and SEO, enabling assistive technologies to accurately interpret the content structure.

### Architecture Overview

- **Modular Design:** The project has been developed with a clean modular architecture, using ES module imports and exports to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **Lightweight and Dependency-Free:** Built with vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, the project avoids heavy libraries or frameworks, focusing on simplicity and performance. Combines procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming techniques for simplicity and flexibility.
- **Performance-Focused:** Minimal dependencies and clean code contribute to fast loading times and a smooth user experience across all devices.
